# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made "Wonka - Random Quote Generator" Used CSS layout from my FCC tribute page project with some tweaks. Completed JS code for image and quote randomness / refresh button. 

**Thoughts:** Need to study working with the DOM. Had some trouble linking the JS in the correct place to effect page. Need to research this gap in my understanding.
