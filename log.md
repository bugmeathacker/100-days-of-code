# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made "Wonka - Random Quote Generator" Used CSS layout from my FCC tribute page project with some tweaks. Completed JS code for image and quote randomness / refresh button. 

**Thoughts:** Need to study working with the DOM. Had some trouble linking the JS in the correct place to effect page. Need to research this gap in my understanding.

### Day 2: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started BOTW Armor page. Worked on the layout using grid. 

**Thoughts:** Research how best to set grid measurements. Not really sure which is the best or if it matters.

### Day 3: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: BOTW Armor page. Worked on dynamically changing cotent in a div without reloading. 

**Thoughts:** Tried using getElementById and struggled to get it to work unless the targeted element was not nested in other elements. After a lot of trying I switched to using querySelector and was able to get that working easier.

### Day 4: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: BOTW Armor page. Worked on dynamically changing cotent in a div without reloading. 

**Thoughts:** Got the dynamic content working. The main armor section test is done. Still need create a data structure to hold all the different armors. Also, did some visual work. Added a background, some transparency, and text sizing.

### Day 5: May 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Haven't transfered over my BOTW files to my new setup yet. Started a layout experiment based on the hub.docker website. 

**Thoughts:** Was trying block display. Not sure how to work with it yet. Having trouble getting text to align within header.

### Day 6: May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Docker layout. Switched to grid. Created main section and footer.
